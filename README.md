# Finding the share of digital vacancies of a company 

Sript on Jupyter Notebooks to automatically categorise job vacancies on whether they are digital, management or both based on a list of keywords. The categoriser gives the share of digital vacancies as well as the share of digital management vacancies. This helps gauge the extent to which an organization is recruiting digital talent in-house. 

The original script was written for the airline industry, with this particular set of keywords applying to the job vacancies of Jet Blue on Glasdoor. Attention should be given to make sure the list of keywords is appropiate for the language and/or industry. 

# Getting the data to categorise 

The data was gathered through web scraping of company career websites and/or job portals. One should be chosen to avoid double counting.
